Here is a website i made to talk about why I would be interested in working at SovTech.

### Usage

Click [Here](https://tomasi001.github.io/react-app/) to view the Website: 

### Bootstrapping

If this is what is meant by bootstrapping - "the starting of a self-sustaining process that is supposed to proceed without external input"

Then all you have to do is click the link and the website is a self sustaining process.

### To run website locally 
- this is assuming you have node.js installed on your machine
- download zip file and extract to an empty directory
- open your command line interface and navigate to that directory
- once in directory type npm install
- once that is finished type npm start
- if you followed the steps correctly the app should now be running on your machine
